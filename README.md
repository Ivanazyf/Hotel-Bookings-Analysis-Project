# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis-Project

Sometimes customers will cancel their reservations due to various reasons, which results in the increase of room vacancy rate and also the decrease of hotel profit. So this project aims to predict customers behavior of whether or not cancelling the reservation through training machine learning models. 

This project is mainly composed of the following steps:

* Utilized Python to train Machine Learning models including Logistic Regression, KNN, LDA and QDA, based on over 100,000 rows of data.
* Evaluated and selected the optimal model with the highest accuracy value of 83% to predict customers’ cancellation behavior 
* Proposed business insights and business strategies to improve hotel’s profits and lower cancellation rates
